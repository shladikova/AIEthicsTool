# ðŸš— Autonomous Driving Industry

## Privacy

AVs rely heavily on data to operate its various functions (planning, learning, etc), which makes these systems vulnerable to privacy[^1] breaches thus risking exposure of personal information.

## Accountability, Responsibility, Liability

&#x20;Accountability[^2], responsibility[^3] and liability[^4] issues are particularly challenging in the AV context because of the fragmentation of the technology action among many agents (many-hands problem) which hinders traceability.

## Fairness, Non-Discrimination, Justice

## Transparency

## Safety and Cybersecurity

## Common good and Sustainability

## Explainability and Interpretability

## Human Oversight, Control, Auditing

## Dual use problem and military

## Solidarity, Inclusion, Social Cohesion

## Science-Policy link

## Diversity

## Future of Employment

## Public Awareness and Education about AVs and its Risks

## Human Autonomy

## Protection of whistleblowers

## Hidden costs

## Legislative framework, legal status of AI systems

## Responsible/intensified research funding

## Certification for AI products

## Cultural differences in the ethically aligned design of AI Systems





[^1]: Modern accounts of privacy focus on the control over the inner spheres of personal information from the scrutiny of the public.

[^2]: Accountability entails responsibility but unlike the latter it requires explanations about actions and it cannot be shared.&#x20;

[^3]: Responsibility for an action requires traditionally at least a control condition, i.e. an agent is responsible if it is the agent of the action, and an epistemic condition, i.e. awareness or knowledge of the agent regarding the action.&#x20;

[^4]: Liability is legal or financial responsibility.
