# ðŸŽ¨ Design

This design phase consists of defining the technical details of the algorithm. In this phase organizations should include ethical requirements along with design requirements. The team should review the items displayed below and address the items that are not checked.



### Algorithm

* Can someone on the team explain how the algorithm works in a way that is understandable for technical and non-technical individuals?

### Source

* Were the data collection practices documented and reviewed?

### Anonymization

* &#x20;Will the data be anonymized or pseudo-anonymized?
* &#x20;Is the access to encryption key to depseudonymize the data secure?

### Visualization

* &#x20;Are the results of the project suitable for visualization?

### Access

* Are the conditions to access the data specified?

### Sharing, Using, Repurposing

* If open access to (parts of) the data will be provided, has the team considered what opportunities and risks might arise?

### Responsibility

* &#x20;Does the project comply with relevant laws and regulations?
* &#x20;Are the responsible persons for the project clearly defined?
* &#x20;Are the tasks and responsibilities of that person clear, with regard to this project?

### Communication

* &#x20;Are communication strategies defined in case something fails?

### Transparency

* &#x20;Is the team transparent about the risks associated with the project?
* &#x20;Is there a risk that the public reception will be negative?

### Privacy

* Was a Privacy Impact Assessment carried out?&#x20;
* &#x20;Is there a privacy officer assigned to the project?
* &#x20;Is privacy ensured in the case that the project is using personal data?

### Bias

* &#x20;Will the results of the analysis be evaluated by a human before being implemented?
* &#x20;Does your model have a feedback loop that could create negative consequences?
* &#x20;Are you gathering the information that is appropriate for the purposes of your project?
