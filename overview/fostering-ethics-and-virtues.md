# ✨ Fostering Ethics and Virtues

Organizations dealing with AI Research & Development should foster a virtuous environment that can support putting AI Ethics into practice. A virtuous environment is one in which people are encouraged to pursue their moral values. Some conditions and organizational measurements can help fostering such virtuous environment.

### **Measures related to individuals**

* **Knowledge about AI Ethics & Virtues:** Practitioners should be familiar with AI Ethics and Virtues
* **Knowledge about Action Strategies:** Practitioners should be familiar with action strategies to mitigate ethically relevant problems related to fairness, robustness, explainability, and also in terms of organizational diversity, clickwork outsourcing, sustainability goals, etc.
* **Locus of Control:** Practitioners should be aware that they are able to influence and have a tangible impact on ethically relevant issues.
* **Public Commitment:** Practitioners should be aware that they can explicitly communicate the willingness to take action in ethical challenges. Publicly committing to stick to particular virtues, ideals, intentions and moral resolutions causes individuals to feel strongly obliged to actually do so when encountering respective choices.
* **Audits and discussion groups:** Practitioners should reflect and discuss professional choices, ethical issues or other concerns in one’s daily routines in order to receive critical feedback.
